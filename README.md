# Alphabet Encryptor - Documentation

### Project Overview

The **Alphabet Encryptor** is a tool that uses homoglyph substitution to hide text by replacing regular characters with visually similar characters from other alphabets (e.g., Cyrillic, Greek, Mathematical, etc.).

This tool is useful for circumventing word filters, hiding text from bots or spam filters, and demonstrating the power of visual encryption while keeping the text legible for humans.

### Features

- Encrypts text using homoglyph substitution.
- Easy-to-use interface with input and output text areas.
- Fast encryption process with real-time results.
- Visually stunning effects with a matrix-like background animation.

### How It Works

To use the tool, simply input your text into the "Enter text to encrypt" field, click the "Encrypt" button, and the encrypted version of the text will appear in the output area.

The encryption works by replacing each character in the input with a visually similar character from different character sets (e.g., Cyrillic, Greek, Mathematical).

#### Example:

- Input: **Chase Bank**
- Encrypted: **Сhаѕе Βаոk**
